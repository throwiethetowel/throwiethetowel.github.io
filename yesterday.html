	<h1>KDP BIG NUMBER YESTERDAY</h1>
        Use this bookmarket while logged into KDP and looking at your KDP Reports. It will provide you with a display of how much money you earned YESTERDAY (updated every twelve hours - if you intend to run this bookmarklet and leave it running for an always-updated "yesterday", you should probably run it at 12:01AM or 12:01PM).
        Drag this link to your bookmarks bar: <a href="javascript:(function()%7Bdocument.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://throwiethetowel.github.io/bignumberyd.js';%7D)();">YESTERDAY'S BIG NUMBER</a><br /><br />
